This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in JavaScript's handling of NaN (Not a Number) within conditional statements. The `foo` function attempts to categorize numbers based on their values. However, it incorrectly classifies NaN as a positive number (1) instead of returning NaN.  This is because NaN does not equal itself in JavaScript (NaN === NaN evaluates to false). The solution demonstrates how to correctly detect and handle NaN to produce the expected output.
